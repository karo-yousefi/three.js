		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A light that gets emitted from a single point in all directions. A common
			use case for this is to replicate the light emitted from a bare
			lightbulb.<br /><br />

			This light can cast shadows - see [page:PointLightShadow] page for
			details. <br /><br />

			The intensity of this light diminishes as the distance from the source increases.
			Both the rate of decay and the maximum effective distance can be adjusted.
		</p>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>

		<code>
const light = new THREE.PointLight( 0xff0000, 1, 100 );
light.position.set( 50, 50, 50 );
scene.add( light );
		</code>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>
			[name]( [param:Integer color], [param:Float intensity], [param:Number distance], [param:Float decay] )
		</h3>
		<p>
			[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default
			is 0xffffff (white).<br />
			[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's
			strength/intensity. Default is `1`.<br />
			[page:Number distance] - Maximum range of the light. Default is `0` (no
			limit).<br />
			[page:Float decay] - The amount the light dims along the distance of the
			light. Default is `2`.<br /><br />

			Creates a new [name].
		</p><br />

		<p>
			The decay property determines how the light intensity fades over distance and interacts 
			with the distance property. However, the two are independent. The decay property does 
			not alter the maximum physical distance the light can reach but instead controls the
			rate at which its intensity diminishes within the specified range. Decay follows this formula: <br />
		</p>

		<p>Intensity = Initial Intensity / (Distance)<sup>decay</sup></p><br />

		<p>
			The distances are not exact.
		</p><br />


		<p>
			Below you can see the effect of decay in similar situations.<br /><br />
			decay = 0
		</p>

		<p>
			decay = 1
		</p>
		<img src="resources/lights/example-decay-1.png" alt="Decay of one" width="650px" height="100%" /><br /><br />


		<p>
			The decay property in can also take negative values, This can be used for
			creating some interesting results. Example:
		</p>

		<code>
			const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight("#079", 8, 6, -3);
pointLight.position.set(-2, 0.1, 2); // Very close to the floor
pointLight.castShadow = true;
scene.add(pointLight);

scene.add(new THREE.PointLightHelper(pointLight, 0.2));
		</code><br />

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
		<p>
			If set to `true` light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is
			expensive and requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the
			[page:PointLightShadow] for details. The default is `false`.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
		<p>
			The amount the light dims along the distance of the light. Default is
			`2`.<br />
			In context of physically-correct rendering the default value should not be
			changed.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
		<p>
			When distance is zero, light will attenuate according to inverse-square
			law to infinite distance. When distance is non-zero, light will attenuate
			according to inverse-square law until near the distance cutoff, where it
			will then attenuate quickly and smoothly to 0. Inherently, cutoffs are not
			physically correct.
		</p>
		<p>Default is `0.0`.</p>

		<h3>[property:Float intensity]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's luminous intensity measured in candela (cd). Default is `1`.
			<br /><br />
			Changing the intensity will also change the light's power.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float power]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's power.<br />
			Power is the luminous power of the light measured in lumens (lm).
			<br /><br />

			Changing the power will also change the light's intensity.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:PointLightShadow shadow]</h3>
		<p>
			A [page:PointLightShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.<br /><br />

			The lightShadow's [page:LightShadow.camera camera] is set to a
			[page:PerspectiveCamera] with [page:PerspectiveCamera.fov fov] of `90`,
			[page:PerspectiveCamera.aspect aspect] of `1`, [page:PerspectiveCamera.near near] 
			clipping plane at `0.5` and [page:PerspectiveCamera.far far] clipping
			plane at `500`.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Light Light] class for common methods.</p>

		<h3>[method:undefined dispose]()</h3>
		<p>
			Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this
			method whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:this copy]( [param:PointLight source] )</h3>
		<p>
			Copies value of all the properties from the [page:PointLight source] to
			this PointLight.
